# This is an example link script file for use when linking real mode
# NOVLIB programs with CA-Clipper
#
# The module i5 is associated with the Print Server & IPX/SPX
# functions and must be linked into the root because it contains
# internal real time event functions.
# These non-overlayable modules are small and represent very little
# overhead to the application.
# All other modules can be overlayed.
