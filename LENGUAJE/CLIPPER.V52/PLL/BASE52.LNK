#  The following lines are provided to allow inclusion of one of the
#  various general terminal (GT) drivers.  By default, Terminal.lib
#  will be used.  If another driver is desired, simply comment out
#  the reference to Terminal.lib below and uncomment one of the other
#  terminal drivers.  The PCBIOS and ANSITerm GT drivers require that
#  the object file gt.obj be linked in.  This file is located in the
#  \OBJ directory of the default installation.  If the OBJ environment
#  variable is set to the \OBJ directory, RTLink will locate it
#  automatically.

#
#  The following lines are provided to allow inclusion of one or more
#  of the various Replaceable Database Drivers (RDDs).  The system
#  program file Rddsys.prg defines which driver will operate as the
#  default.  The version of Rddsys.prg provided makes Dbfntx.lib the
#  default RDD.  In order to change the default RDD, this file must be 
#  changed to refer to the RDD desired.  Rddsys.prg can be found
#  in the SOURCE\SYS subdirectory of the installation.  To include any
#  of the RDDs listed below uncomment its line.  For example, to include
#  the Dbfmdx RDD, uncomment the line "lib dbfmdx  refer dbfmdx" below.
#
lib dbfntx  refer dbfntx
#  lib dbfndx  refer dbfndx
#  lib dbfmdx  refer dbfmdx
#  lib dbfcdx  refer dbfcdx
#  lib dbpx    refer dbpx

#
#  If you are providing an alternate Rddsys (Rddsys.obj) to establish
#  another RDD as the default driver, uncomment the "file RDDSYS" line
#  and comment out the "exclude RDDSYS" line below.
