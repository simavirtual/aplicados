#
#  CL87MAX.LNK - Summer '87 Clipper/Extend Script
#
#  Overlay EXTEND.LIB and large amounts of CLIPPER.LIB
#
#  This script MUST be included outside of any BEGINAREA / ENDAREA commands
#  and after all libraries except LLIBCA if it is being used.
#
#  NOTE: for ease of use this script should be stored in your library directory,
#  (the directory pointed to by the LIB environment variable), which will allow
#  Blinker to find the script without you having to specify a full path.
#
#  Modules within CLIPPER.LIB are, by their nature, called very frequently
#  within any CLIPPER application. Therefore, overlaying these routines
#  will almost certainly result in some performance degradation, which can
#  be minimised by increasing the OVERLAY OPSIZE.
#
#  The amount of performance degradation will vary from application to
#  application, so it may be necessary to modify this script by commenting
#  out some MODULE statements to increase performance to an acceptable level
#  in some areas.
#
#  Please note that some third party libraries may replace or modify routines
#  in the CLIPPER library, so that they are no longer overlayable. The link
#  time command BLINKER MESSAGE DUPLICATES may help in determining such
#  conflicts or replacements.
