#
#  CL87MIN.LNK - Summer '87 Clipper/Extend Script
#
#  Minimal overlaying - only overlay EXTEND.LIB
#
#  This script MUST be included outside of any BEGINAREA / ENDAREA commands
#  and after all libraries except LLIBCA if it is being used.
#
#  NOTE: for ease of use this script should be stored in your library directory,
#  (the directory pointed to by the LIB environment variable), which will allow
#  Blinker to find the script without you having to specify a full path.
