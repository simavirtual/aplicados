# Blinker 2.0+ Sample Link file for Clipper Summer '87
#
# This sample script is intended to be used as a template for your own scripts
#
# Please refer to the manual for specific instructions for 3rd party libraries.
# In all cases the information provided by the vendor of a library for linking
# with BLINKER should supercede information in the Blinker manual or files.
#
# This script is set up a a development script, that enables incremental
# linking, and overlays only EXTEND.LIB from the Nantucket libraries. When
# incremental linking is enabled, applications will use somewhat more memory
# than normal, due to a certain amount of 'padding' being left at the end
# of each Clipper procedure, but this is offset by the extremely fast
# incremental link times.
#
# Before shipping a completed application, you should disable the incremental
# linking feature, which will save memory, and increase execution speed by:
#
#         a) Removing the padding between procedures
#         b) Turning on symbol table compression
#
# To disable incremental linking and enable symbol table compression
# UNCOMMENT the following command:
#
#BLINKER INCREMENTAL OFF
#
# Burn in your own Clipper variables here eg: F25;E0;R16;V10;
#
BLINKER EXECUTABLE CLIPPER F25;E0;R16;V10;
#
# Enable free pool defragmentation
#

# Specify the EXE filename here:
#

#
# List your Clipper S'87 object modules here. The first FILE mentioned in any
# Blinker link script MUST be a Clipper code module. The first module may be
# overlaid, so for maximum memory savings overlay all Clipper code.
