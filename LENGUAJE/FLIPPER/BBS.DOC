               |______________________________________________|


     "X" means exit.  Use it to exit to a higher level menu.  When you're
         at the main menu, enter "X" to log off the system.

     "/p" means page another user.  Follow with a User-ID and a message,
         for example:  "/p Mackenzie We still need quorum on the Fresno
         initiative".  User Mackenzie, if online, would get this message
         on his terminal.

     "/r" means look up a user in the Registry, for example:  "/r Baker".

     "/#" shows you who else is also online with you.

     Also, most long listings can be aborted by hitting <Return> or
         <Enter> while the list is scrolling across your screen.



Concatenated Commands
---------------------

You can probably find most things you're looking for by just going through the
menus one at a time.  But here are a few "concantenated" commands you can
enter right from the main menu, responding to several sub-menus in one swoop:

     "ERT." means scan your incoming mail starting just after the last
         message you have already read.  This will include private mail
         sent specifically to you, replies to your public messages in
         the Special Interest Groups, and public messages to you in the
         SIGs.

     "EW<userid>" means write a message to another user, for example
         "EWSysop" to write a note to your System Operator.

     "SRQS" means Quickscan the Special Interest Groups for new
         public messages.

     "SRQC" means configure and customize your own Quickscan to look
         only in certain SIGs or only for messages with certain keywords
         in them.

     "SS?" gets you a listing of SIGs.  (Hit return an extra time to
         abort this listing.)

     "SS<signame> RLB0" shows you a line-by-line summary of all
         messages in a particular SIG.



E - Electronic Mail
-------------------

Electronic Mail, or E-Mail for short, allows you to exchange messages with
other users on the BBS.  E-Mail includes private messages from one user to
another.  Special Interest Groups or SIGs include public messages that many
users can read and reply to.  Otherwise, E-Mail and SIG messages are very
similar, and have many of the same properties.

For example, an E-Mail or SIG message can have an "attachment" or file that is
uploaded by the writer and downloaded by the reader.  In fact, this text file
is itself an attachment to an E-Mail message that was automatically sent to
you when you signed up on this BBS.

Here is the Electronic Mail menu:

   R => Read message(s)
   W => Write a message
   M => Modify a message
   E => Erase a message
   X => Exit from E-Mail



Reading Your E-Mail
-------------------

You can read these types of mail:

   T ... to read all messages TO you, including replies to public messages
         you wrote in the SIGs.
   P ... to read only the messages that are TO you PRIVATELY, not including
         SIG messages directed to you.
   F ... to read messages FROM you (SIG or E-Mail)

When reading mail, first you see a header that looks something like this:

   E-Mail #81220 04-JUN-96 17:48 (Reply to #79617)
   From: Graham
     To: Dole (private message)
     Re: Superdemocracy experiment in Fresno CA

At that point you can:

   N ... move forward to the Next message
   P ... move backward to the Previous message
   R ... Read this message

After reading the body of a message, if a file is attached you can download
it using one of these file transfer protocols:

   L ... List the file on your screen, one screen at a time
   A ... ASCII download of file, continuously (CTRL-S pauses)

   M ... XMODEM download             G ... YMODEM-g download (batch)
   C ... XMODEM-CRC download         Z ... ZMODEM download
   Y ... YMODEM (1K XMODEM)          ZR .. Resume ZMODEM download
   B ... YMODEM Batch                K ... KERMIT / SUPER KERMIT download

After reading any message and possibly downloading the attachment, you can:

   R ... Reply to this message and erase it (for messages TO you only)
   E ... Erase this message
   C ... Clear message from mailbox (for SIG messages directed to you only)
   M ... Modify your message (for messages FROM you only)
   F ... Forward the message to another user or to a SIG (messages TO you)
   B ... Backtrack to the original message (this message is itself a reply)
   P ... move back to the Previous message
   N ... move forward to the Next message



Writing E-Mail
--------------

You can write E-Mail to another user (such as the Sysop or System Operator),
or to a Special Interest Group.  You can also write a public message to
another user that appears in a specific SIG.  Some examples of commands from
the main menu:

   EWSysop              write a private message to the Sysop
   EWMirsky             write a private message to user Mirsky
   EW/Hello             write a message to all users for the /Hello SIG
   EW/Superdem -Fred    write a message to user Fred for the /Superdem SIG


You can also attach a file to a message you are writing.  Upload protocols
include:

   A ... ASCII upload              B ... YMODEM Batch
   M ... XMODEM upload             G ... YMODEM-g upload (batch)
   C ... XMODEM-CRC upload         Z ... ZMODEM upload
   Y ... YMODEM (1K XMODEM)        K ... KERMIT / SUPER KERMIT upload



S - SIGs (Special Interest Groups)
----------------------------------

SIG messages are very much like E-Mail messages, except that many users can
read them instead of just one.

Here is the SIG menu:

   R => Read messages
   W => Write a message
   D => Download a file
   U => Upload a file
   T => Teleconference
   S => Select a new SIG

By the way, you can modify a SIG message you have written by noting the
message number and using the M=Modify option in Electronic Mail.

Use the "S" option to select a SIG.  Type "S?" to get a listing of SIGs.  (Hit
return while the list is scrolling on your screen to abort the list.)

Each SIG has a teleconference channel reserved for a live on-the-air
discussion associated with the Special Interest Group.



Read / Download SIG Options
---------------------------

Reading SIG messages is the same thing as Downloading SIG files, except that
Downloading only looks at messages with files attached.  There are several
options either way.

When it comes time to download an attachment to a SIG message, these are your
protocol options:

   L ... List the file on your screen, one screen at a time
   A ... ASCII download of file, continuously (CTRL-S pauses)

   M ... XMODEM download             G ... YMODEM-g download (batch)
   C ... XMODEM-CRC download         Z ... ZMODEM download
   Y ... YMODEM (1K XMODEM)          ZR .. Resume ZMODEM download
   B ... YMODEM Batch                K ... KERMIT / SUPER KERMIT download

Here are some possible "concatenated" commands for reading/downloading SIG
messages/files.  These commands can be typed from the SIG menu (each letter
corresponds to a sub-menu selection):

   RK     DK      Keyword-search for messages/files
   RS     DS      Chronological Scan for messages/files
   RLB    DLB     Non-stop list of messages/file descriptions (1 line each)
   RLT    DLT     Non-stop list of messages/file descriptions (4 lines each)
   RLF    DLF     Non-stop list of messages/file descriptions (full-text)
   RQK    DQK     Quickscan-Keyword search for messages/files
   RQS    DQS     Quickscan of messages/files
   RQLB   DQLB    Quickscan list of messages/file descriptions (1 line each)
   RQLT   DQLT    Quickscan list of messages/file descriptions (4 lines each)
   RQLF   DQLF    Quickscan list of messages/file descriptions (full-text)
   RQC    DQC     Quickscan configuration



Scanning and Listing
--------------------

During a scan, you view message summaries one at a time, and optionally read
the body of each message.  During a list, the summaries and message bodies fly
by one after another.  For either a scan or a list you can start at a specific
message number.  The default starting point is just after the most recent
message whose body you have already read in each SIG.

To abort a long listing, hit return while the list is scrolling across your
screen.



Keyword-Search for SIG Messages
-------------------------------

You can search for messages in a SIG based on the content of the topic and
message.  However, the contents of any files attached to messages are not
scanned in the keyword search.  Here are some examples of keyword search
specifications:

   Enter a keyword list:  quorum              Find all messages with the word
                                              "quorum" in them.

   Enter a keyword list:  quorum proxy        Find all messages with both the
                                              word "quorum" and the word
                                              "proxy" in them.



Quickscan Search for Messages
------------------------------

Quickscan is an advanced search for messages or files that you can custom
tailor to your interests.  You can limit the quickscan to certain SIGs, and to
certain subjects with these SIGs.  Also each quickscan searches begins "where
you left off" in a SIG, so you only review new messages.

To specify which SIGs to include in your quickscan, you need to configure your
quickscan ("RQ" from the SIG menu the first time, "RQC" after that).  You can
remove or add SIGs using + and - commands:

   -/Sugar
   -/Shale            ..no longer quickscan the /Sugar and /Shale SIGs
   +/Solar            ..include /Solar and /Superdem SIGS in quickscan
   +/Superdem

You can also specify up to 5 keyword lists.  Only messages/file descriptions
that match one or more of the keyword lists will pop up during the quickscan.
The contents of attached files are NOT searched for keywords.



Threading through SIG Messages
------------------------------

After reading a SIG message, you have the option to:

   TB    Thread Backward to the most recent message with the same topic
   TF    Thread Forward to the very next message with the same topic
   TP    Thread to the Parent of this message (this message is itself a
         reply to another SIG message).

Threading around through a tree of messages will not disturb your place
in a quickscan, if it is in progress.



Write/Upload a SIG Message/File
-------------------------------

Writing and uploading are the same thing, except that when you upload, you
always attach a file to the message.  (When writing, you have the option of
attaching a file.)  When uploading, the message topic becomes the file name
followed by a brief description.  The message itself becomes a long
description for the file.

A reply to an existing SIG message is directed to the writer of the original
message.  New SIG messages can be directed to all users or to a specific user.
In any case the message is available to anyone with the proper access to that
SIG.

Here are the upload protocols available for attachments to a SIG message:

   A ... ASCII upload              B ... YMODEM Batch
   M ... XMODEM upload             G ... YMODEM-g upload (batch)
   C ... XMODEM-CRC upload         Z ... ZMODEM upload
   Y ... YMODEM (1K XMODEM)        K ... KERMIT / SUPER KERMIT upload



T - Teleconferencing
--------------------

Teleconferencing is a lot like a CB radio, except with computer terminals.
Type a message at your terminal and it will get sent to everybody else on your
channel.

Here are some special teleconference commands:

   PAGE <Userid> ...       "pages" the user to your teleconference channel
   PAGE ON/OFF/OK          allows/prevents/encourages others to page you
   WHISPER TO <Userid> ... sends a private message to another conferee
   /<Userid> ...           (shorthand form of the whisper command)
   CHANNEL <#>             switch to channel <#> of teleconferencing
   CHAT <Userid>           join in a "chat" with a user, or request it
   SCAN                    displays all teleconference users on all channels
   UNLIST                  makes your channel number "unlisted" in scans
   LIST                    allows others to see your channel number in scans
   MODERATE <topic>        sets conference topic and makes you the moderator
   APPOINT <Userid>        (moderator only) resign, make <Userid> moderator
   SQUELCH <Userid>        (moderator only) silence user in your conference
   UNSQUELCH <Userid>      (moderator only) allow the user to talk again
   EXIT, or just X         exits teleconference, takes you back to main menu

When you're in the middle of typing your message, the BBS politely refrains
from showing you other peoples messages, until you are done typing and hit
<CR> (or you backspace to the beginning of the line).



F - File Library
----------------

The File Library makes files available online for download.  Files are
organized into LIBs (Library Information Banks).

Here is the Library menu:

   G => General information
   S => Select a LIB (type 'S?' for a list)
   F => File directory
   D => Download a file (or just search for one)
   U => Upload a file

You always end up first in the MAIN LIB after you log on.  Type "S" to select
a different LIB.  Type "S?" for a listing of LIBs.  Type "F" for a list of
files in the current LIB.  General information includes an online tutorial on
the File Library.

When you are in the MAIN LIB, file lists and file searches apply to the files
in all of the LIBS.  In other LIBs, lists and searches only apply within that
LIB.



Download Search in the File Library
-----------------------------------

You can search for files based on their LIB, file name, keywords, or when they
were uploaded.

   D keyword              Search alphabetically through the file keywords

   D filename             Display information about a file in the current LIB

   D libname\filename     Display information about a file in a specific LIB

   D -0                   Search chronologically through files that have
                          been uploaded today

   D -7                   Search chronologically through files that have
                          been uploaded within the last week

   D MM/DD/YY             Search chronologically through files that were
                          uploaded on the date MM/DD/YY

After specifying a keyword, date or number-of-days-ago, you get a numbered
list of files.

For example, say you were in the MAIN LIB and entered a command like "D FED".
You might get something like this:

      ____Keyword____  __LIB___  __Filename__  __________Description________
   1  federal          REFEREND  RFLIST.ZIP    List of federal referenda, 1994
   2  ferrous          ENERGY    EI94062.DOC   Ferrous Chromate energy initiati
   3  ficus            MEDICAL   TROPCURE.RPT  Medical uses for tropical plants
   4  FISHING.ZIP      DOLPHINS  FISHING.ZIP   New tuna fishing initiatives
   5  fusion           ENERGY    RES0442.ZIP   Energy research initiative 0442

After which you can type:

   1-5          pick one of the files
   F            scan Forward, alphabetically
   B            scan Backward, alphabetically
   MM/DD/YY     search for files uploaded on MM/DD/YY
   -DD          search for files uploaded DD days ago
   <filename>   get information on a specific file
   <keyword>    keyword search starting somewhere else

After selecting a specific file, you get more information on it such as who
uploaded it, file size, descriptions, etc.  Then you have these options:

   L --> List this file, one screen at a time   \ Use these options
   A --> Download it using ASCII text protocol  / only on ASCII files

   M --> XMODEM download               G --> YMODEM-g download (batch)
   C --> XMODEM-CRC download           Z --> ZMODEM download
   Y --> YMODEM (1K XMODEM)            ZR -> Resume ZMODEM download
   B --> YMODEM Batch                  K --> KERMIT download

   S ... Search for another file
   R ... Review the description of this file

Some LIBs may be "DOS-only" and have no keywords or file descriptions
associated with them.  In that case, you can only specify a file name for
download.



Batch File Download
-------------------

You can also download several files in a row by specifying a command like:

   D *.EXE *.COM *.BAT README.DOC Z

where the "Z" stands for the ZMODEM protocol.

Here are all the choices for multi-file download protocols.

   B --> YMODEM Batch multi-file download
   G --> YMODEM-g multi-file download
   Z --> ZMODEM multi-file download
   ZR -> Resume ZMODEM multi-file download
   K --> KERMIT multi-file download



Uploading in the File Library
-----------------------------

Some LIBs may be available for you to upload files.  In that case you will be
asked to enter a file name, short and long descriptions, and up to 10
keywords.  Keep in mind that the file name is always automatically entered as
a keyword, so if your file is named "FUSIONRF.DOC", there is little need to
give it a keyword like "fusion,referenda".

Some LIBs may be "DOS-only", and not require keywords or descriptions.



Batch File Upload
-----------------

You may be able to upload several files at once using a batch protocol:

   U * Z

where "Z" stands for ZMODEM protocol.  Here are all the multi-file upload
protocols:

   B --> YMODEM Batch upload
   G --> YMODEM-g upload (batch)
   Z --> ZMODEM upload
   K --> KERMIT upload



A - Account Display and Edit
----------------------------

Here you can edit the information you first provided to the Sysop when you
signed up on this BBS.  For example, you could change the following
information numbered 1-12:

   User-ID .................. Cromero
   Account Created .......... 10/18/89
   Last Logon ............... 02/29/96

    1. Name ........... Cesar Romero
