At the time the manual was printed the product was still under
development and some additional features have been added since that
time. The Norton Guides database should always have the latest
information. Any changes or bug fixes will be available on the BBS -
(503)-567-0363 - with an updated Norton Guides.

1. A library called FLPDEBUG.LIB has been included with this version
   which will determine if you are getting a stack overflow. Some
   libraries use the stack heavily and strange problems can occur. Two
   functions determine how much of the Stack has been used during the
   operations of the program:

      MARK_STACK() - places a byte in all positions on the stack.
      nStackLeft = CHK_STACK() - checks to see how much of the
                   stack has been overwritten.

1. OBJ_ROTATE( nRotation )
         nRotation          - rotate object in tenths of degrees

1. PS_ROTATE has been enhanced again allowing you to set the p1 and p2
   points and now return the current values. See C_EXAM7A.PRG.

      a. To set orientation and size of image:

         nOrientation = PS_ROTATE([nOrientation] [,p1x, p1y, p2x, p2y] )

      b. To return the values, pass parameters by reference:

         PS_ROTATE( @nOrientation] ,@p1x, @p1y, @p2x, @p2y )

2. The color palette will now be set for PCX pictures automatically. This
   changes the default color palette set when flipper goes into graphics
   mode.

1. The screen drivers for Clipper 5.01 are ready for testing. Look at
   example G_EXAM43.PRG. This is an examples of implementing the
   screen drivers for Clipper 5.01. Since Nantucket has not yet
   released the screen driver API information, I had to modify the
   screen driver source code.  However  FLIPTEXT.OBJ should run
   Clipper 5.01 in graphics mode transparently.

   SETMODE(43,80) or SETMODE(50,80) can be used to extend the rows for
   the screen drivers. At this time time you can only display 80
   columns, this should change when the API is released.

   FLIPTEXT.OBJ should be linked in as a FI in the script file

   DRV_BEGIN()    - Starts the screen drivers. Must be in graphics mode
   DRV_END()      - Ends the screen drivers. Allows Clipper to run in
                    text mode.
   DRV_FONT(fh)   - Set the font to be used for the screen drivers
   DRV_CURSOR(fg) - Set the color for the cursor.

2. The palette conversion for displaying a pcx picture has been correctly
   has been fixed.

3. The scroll bars will now work with a viewport. See C_DEMO.PRG

4. The MENU_EDIT function will unhighlight a button if the fourth parameter
   is zero.

5. SCANNER.LIB in the library subdirectory will scann from an HP ScanJet
   and ScanJet+ scanner. See S_EXAM01.PRG and S_EXAM02.PRG.

********************************************************************
As of 6/13/91 FLIP5.LIB date: The norton guides have the latest
                              documentation. N_GUIDES.ZIP
1. Scroll bar stuff changed:
   a. nScrollNum = SCRL_OPEN(nOrientation,nStart,nEnd,nLocation,nItems
                              [,nStartItem])
            color set with current MENU_COLOR
   b. SCRL_CLOSE( nScrollNum )
   c. SCRL_WAKE( nScrollNum [,nStartItem])
   d. SCRL_SLEEP( nScrollNum )
   e. SCRL_HOT( nScrollNum )
   f. SCRL_SET( nScrollNum, nStartNum )

   The other SCROLL function have been replaced by these. See C_EXAM04.PRG
   in EXAMPLES.ZIP. Also in EXTRA.ZIP. You can have up to 10 scroll bars
   open at the same time. They are now also 3d.

2. MENU_EDIT now has a fourth optional parameter called nMemuItem. You can
   change the menu item that is highlighted under program control rather
   than just with the mouse. See C_EXAM04.PRG in EXAMPLES.ZIP or EXTRA.ZIP.

3. MENU_OPEN nType now has an additional number 4 type. This will add a
   scroll bar to the right side of a menu. See C_EXAM04.PRG.

4. BUTTON_ADD can now take an optional 10th parameter that will allow you
   to place a SAY_FMT string that will be placed where you wish on the
   screen for a button. See C_EXAM04.PRG in EXAMPLES.ZIP or EXTRA.ZIP for
   the Map menu.

5. MPRT_OPEN has a third optional parameter which sets the maximum memory
   you wish to be allocated for a background screen. If you need other
   memory for an area graph, the allocation for the background screen
   may take so much that you will be out of memory for the area fills.
   The usual starting value is 60k. You could reduce in to 16 or 32 which
   will increase the number of swaths only.

      MPRT_OPEN( nXinches, nYinches [,nMaxBuffer] )

6. Error in the manual for SAY_FMT. AC instead of AM, A should be
   A_  (<-underbar). This did not make it in the norton guides- sorry.

********************************************************************
As of 5/1/91 FLIP5.LIB date:
1. PS_LNWIDTH now PS_LNSTYLE(nCol, nWidth, nPen)
   HP_LNWIDTH now HP_LNSTYLE(nCol, nWidth, nRed, nGreen, nBlue/Gray, color)

   Allowed you to set the color to pen translation for HP and
   colors and gray scaling for Postscript printers.

********************************************************************
As of 5/29/91 FLIP5.LIB date:

Fixes: These were problems reported to ProWorks that were fixed. You
       may not have run into these problems yet.

1. HPGL printing when combined with screen printing. See C_EXAM07.PRG
2. Found some allocations that were not releasing.
3. Fixed the scroll bar. Would bomb if more than 150 items. Now works.
   Colors follow the menu color set at the time the scroll bar is
   drawn.

Enhancements:

1. BUTTON_ADD now has a 10th optional parameter that allow you to put
   in a SAY_FMT string to say text as the button is wakened.
   See C_EXAM04.PRG

2. For those who have HP SCANNERS, we have a scanner module that allows
   you to support the HP scanners.

********************************************************************
As of 4/23/91 FLIP5.LIB date:

Fixes: These were problems reported to ProWorks that were fixed. You
       may not have run into these problems yet.

1. ABS_TO_Y function.
2. SET_YSPACE function
3. FLIP_INIT(0,0) gave error.
4. Postscript printing
5. Long menu labels off cut off to soon.
6. SET_OLAP function
7. GET_GET now works inside a viewport
8. PRT_EDIT fixed for black and white screens.

Additional enhancements:

1. FPOLY_LINE added optional parameter for number of points passed so
   one array could serve for many polygons.

      FPOLY_LINE( nX, nY, aPoints, nColor [,nNumPoints] )

2. HP 7550 plus added for HPGL/2 support.
3. Any letter can be highlighted in the menu label by placing a ^ in
   front of the letter.
4. Support added for dual screens with the mono screen used for
   clipper text and the color screen used for the graphics.
5. AUTO_SCALE will determine the correct graph scale values without
   being in graphics mode.
6. SPLINE function enhanced. Three optional parameters added.

      SPLINE( nYColumn [,nType] [,nIncrement] [nTension] )

         Type      - 0 passes close to the points
                     1 passes through the points  (default)
         Increment - number of segments in the curve

                     segments=1.0/Increment

                     0.2  =   5 segments
                     0.1  =  10 segments
                     0.05 =  20 segments (default)
                     0.01 = 100 segments

         For type 1 only:
         Tension   - 0 to 1: default is 0.5.

7. Gray scaling and color have been added to the postscript driver.

      nIsColor = 0:
         PS_LNWIDTH(nColor,[nWid], *na*, *na*, [nGray],[nIsColor] )
      nIsColor = 1:
         PS_LNWIDTH(nColor,[nWid],[nRed],[nGreen],[nBlue],[nIsColor] )
      nIsColor = 2:
         PS_LNWIDTH(nColor,[nWid],[nHue],[nSat],[nBright],[nIsColor])

         IsColor=0
            nGray       Level of gray for black and white device
                           (0-black, 100-no gray)
         IsColor=1
            nRed        Level of red
            nGreen      Level of green
            nBlue       Level of blue

         IsColor=2
            nRed        Hue
            nGreen      Saturation
            nBlue       Brightness

   The gray scaling can be set with the fifth parameter. The default is all
   colors black and gray scaling. The gray scaling is 0 for all black, 100
   for no color, and everything in between. Each color from 0-15 can be set
   independently.

   There are two methods for representing colors in postscript printers.
   nIsColor 1 is the percentage of red, green, blue. nIsColor 2 is the hue,
   saturation, and brightness method. The ranges are from 0 to 100%.

8. PS_ROTATE has been enhanced to allow you to set the p1 and p2 points.

         nOrientation = PS_ROTATE([nOrientation] [,p1x, p1y, p2x, p2y] )

         nOrientation Sets the orientation of the page.
                      0 - Portrait [Default]]
                      90 - Landscape

   This function sets the orientation of the page to either Portrait or
   Landscape.  It also defaults the P1 and P2 positions so that the aspect
   ratio will be square.

   The size of the postscript screen on the printer is setable with the
   optional parameters p1x, p1y, p2x, & p2y. The position is in 1/72nds of
   an inch.

         The default size is:    Landscape      Portrait
                                 ---------      --------
                           p1x      36             36
                           p1y      36            345
                           p2x     750            576
                           p2y     572            750

9. Pattern filling has been enhanced:

   PAT_SETFIL( nPatternNo [,nSolidColor,nPatternColor,nBGColor])

         nPatternNo     Internal setable pattern number. (2-10)
         nSolidColor    Reset default solid fill color. Default is edge
                        color.
         nPatternColor  Reset default pattern color. Default is the edge
                        color.
         nBGColor       Reset default background color. Default is
                        transparent.

   The default pattern fill colors can be changed by entering the three
   optional parameters. Pattern 1 is will normally fill an object with a
   solid color. This fill color can be changed by changing nSolidColor. A
   filled pattern will normally fill the object with the edge color and the
   background of the pattern will be transparent. These to colors can be
   changed by reseting nPatternColor and nBGColor.

10. PAT_SETLIN( nPatternNo [,nNewPattern] )

   nNewPattern - integer value where each bit represents the
                 pattern.

11. EVENTCALL is called each time the KEY_PRESS() go through an internal
    loop. The function in the library simply returns without any action. You
    can write a UDF that will be called internal to keypress that will allow
    you to do something while the KEY_PRESS is waiting for an event to
    occur. This function will probably slow down the KEY_PRESS event.

12. BUTTONCALL is called each time a menu item is highlighted. The function
    in the library simply returns without any action. You can write a UDF
    that will be called internal to the menu system each time a new
    button is highlighted. This can be used to display a description
    of the highlighted menu item.

13. MENU_COLOR() enhanced with color of hot letter set with a ^.

         MENU_COLOR( nUnFgColor, nUnBgColor, nSelFgColor, nSelBgColor,
                     nNonFgColor, nNonBgColor, nBoxBg, n3dOnOrOff,
                     nBorderType, nBorderColor, nBorderThickness,
                     nShadowType, nShadowColor, nShadowThickness,
                     n3d_fg_color, n3d_bg_color,
                     nFg_letter_color, nBg_letter_color )

         nUnFgColor       Sets the low light foreground.
         nUnBgColor       Sets the low light background.
         nSelFgColor      Sets the highlight foreground.
         nSelBgColor      Sets the highlight background.
         nNonFgColor      Sets the non selected foreground.
         nNonBgColor      Sets the non selected background.
         nBoxBg           Sets the inside box color.
         n3dOnOrOff       Sets the menus to be 3D.
                          0 - 3D off.
                          1 - 3D on.
         nBorderType      Set the border type.
                          0 - border off.
                          1 - show border.
         nBorderColor     Sets the border color.
         nBorderThickness Sets the border thickness in pixels.
         nShadowType      Set the shadow on or off.
                          0 - shadow off.
                          1 - show shadow.
         nShadowColor     Sets the shadow color.
         nShadowThickness Sets the shadow thickness in pixels.
         n3d_fg_color     Sets the 3d effect highlight color.
         n3d_bg_color     Sets the 3d effect lowlight color.
         nFg_letter_color Sets the selected highlight letter color.
         nBg_letter_color Sets the unselected highlight letter color.

14. Parameter 2 added to nHighlight.

         MENU_OPEN( nFont, nGap, nViewport, nDefaultActive,
                           nHighlight, nType, nSaveBackground )
         MENU_EDIT( nMenuNum, nHighlight, nOnOrOff )
         BUTTON_ADD( nMenuNum, nLeft, nTop, nRight, nBottom,
                           nKeyCode, nKeyType, nHighlight, nColor )

         nHighlight  Sets the highlight on or off.
                     0 = Don't highlight when mouse hits button.
                     1 = Highlight when mouse hits button.
                     2 = Highlight only if mouse cursor on button

15. Enhanced search methods for closed objects.

         LAYER_OPEN( nDefaultColor,[nBox],[nPoly],[nCircle])
         LAYER_ON( nLayer,[nActiveStatus],[nBox],[nPoly],[nCircle] )
         HOT_METHOD( nMethod )  Already know the object type.

         nBox              Default search for box method (type 1)
         nPoly             Default search for polygon method (type 2)
         nCircle           Default search for circle method (type 10-17)

   The default search method can be set for new objects created on a layer.
   nBox sets the default search method for a box. If you set it to a -1,
   then it will not be found at all. The default is to find the object by
   touching the mouse cursor on the edge of the object. A setting of 1 will
   find a closed object, polygon or box, when the mouse is anywhere inside
   the object. nPoly and nCircle set the default search method for Polygons
   and Circles.

********************************************************************
As of 1/11/91:

A. Use Flipper with Summer '87 and Clipper 5.0

   Flipper can work with both 5.0 and Summer '87 Clipper. The
   FLIP5.LIB library is used with both Clipper's. The SUMMER87.LIB
   should be linked with Summer '87 Clipper. The CLIP50.LIB should be
   linked with Clipper 5.0. Two small batch files included in the
   examples directory - C87.BAT & C50.BAT - can help you when first
   compiling the examples.

   The Summer '87 version contains a modified Clipper screen driver
   allowing you to do GET's, SAY's, DBEDIT on the graphics screen.
   The previous beta version of the screen drivers has been modified
   to scroll. This special documentation for the screen drivers can
   be found in the Flipper Functions menu item on the Norton Guides
   main menu. Nantucket has not yet provided the screen drivers for
   the Clipper 5.0 version. When those become available I will
   incorporate them into the CLIP50.

   The Clipper 5.0 serial interface did not work as well as the
   Summer '87 version so I added an interrupt driven communications
   module to download the HPGL commands. These functions start with
   ICOM_. Because of this, the HP_SETUP function was separated into
   HP_SETUP and COM_SETUP functions.

B. Changes or additions not in the manual. These changes are
   documented in the Norton Guides database.

   Chapter 4.
      AUTO_SCALE  Additional parameters added for zooming a data set.

   Chapter 7.
      PRT_LIST    Returns the ID and Names of the printers in the
                  driver table.

      HP_LNWIDTH  Set a line width array for a LaserJet III HPGL device.
      PS_LNWIDTH  Set a line width array for a postscript device.

      ICOM_CLOSE  Interrupt drivers for serial communications with
      ICOM_OPEN   plotter.
      ICOM_READ
      ICOM_WRITE

C. Moving from Flipper IV to Flipper 5.0

   1. New manual

      The manual was the most criticized aspect of Flipper IV. We tried
      to incorporate all of the changes suggested by our users - a)
      functions in alphabetical order, b) one function on a page, c)
      tutorial, d) more explanation on each page. You will have to
      tell us if we improved the manual. Because of these changes, we
      felt we had to rename some functions so like functions would
      start with the same name and appear close to each other in the
      manual. For example, SAY_LEGEND was changed to LEGEND_SAY.

   2. Program changes

      a. The printing capabilities have been enhanced:

         1- Print driver expands images 10 times faster.

         2- New background screen to print images at the resolution
            of the screen.  Lets you print a true 300 dot/inch image
            on a HP LaserJet II at 8 by 10 inches in size.

         3- Vector Postscript printing for generating true scaleable
            publication quality images.

         4- Support for internal fonts on the HP LaserJet III in HPGL mode.

         5- Interrupt driven IO drivers which allows you to return
            information from the plotter such as digitized points.

         6- Support for color printers such as Epson LQ2550, HP PaintJet
            and HP PaintJet-XL.

      b. Data storage buffer changes.

         1- Removed the 7 data column limitation. Now you can set the
            column number to any value. The number of rows still
            depends on the size of the FLIP_INIT.

         2- The data in the buffer can be auto scaling before
            printing, or an axis can be placed down without plotting
            the data.

         3- RESET has been changed to FLP_RESET.

      c. Many small requested changes

         1- Color control: You can now set the color of the inside of
                           the graph frame or the inside of the
                           legend frame.

         2- Missing value: You can now include the X axis as part of
                           the missing data.

         3- Styles: The point and fill styles have been changed to
                    reflect the additional number of columns
                    available.

         4- Graph types: An area graph has been added as SET_TYPE 2.
                         The point type has been moved to SET_TYPE 5.

         5- Log charts:  The log charts will now set the minimum and
                         maximum values manually so they can be less
                         than one cycle.

         6- Limit buffer: New function to limit the range of data you
                          plot from the buffer - BUFF_LIMIT(),
                          AUTO_SCALE().

         7- PIE:  The parameters are now in percent of screen
                  distance.

         8- PLOT: limit parameters moved to BUFF_LIMIT.

         9- SAY_LEGEND, SET_LEGEND -> LEGEND_SAY, LEGEND_SET. Also,
            new parameters added- justification, alignment, frame
            line and distance between labels.

         10-SPLINE now uses previous data when the set is limited by
            BUFF_LIMIT.

      d. Fonts handling

         1- Stroke fonts have been added so fonts can be scaled up
            and down and rotate to any angle.

         2- Any bit mapped font can be compiled directly into the
            program so you won't have disk fonts all over the place.
            Please contact ProWorks to get the compiled fonts.

         3- SAY_FIXED allows you to print a font as a fixed space
            font rather than proportionally spaced so tables will
            align correctly.

         4- The third font handle is a 8 wide by 16 high available on
            EGA & VGA cards. The first disk font loaded will be font
            handle 4.

      e. Picture stuff.

         1- Direct PCX to screen display - FPCX_PUT.

         2- Saving images to background video pages.

      f. Drawing stuff

         1- New functions - see chapter 10

         2- FLINE now split into FLINE and FBOX.

         3- CAP_MOVE can return and set the last end point for a
            drawing function.

         4- Fill of any closed figure with PAT_SETFIL

         5- FPOLY_LINE function added.

      g. Viewports

         1- The SET_WORLD now takes the place of all logical coordinate
            setting.

      h. Mouse driver

         1- Totally re-written event driven mouse driver. You can
            detect events such as keyboard presses, mouse buttons,
            region crosses, timer events, and many others depending
            on which functions you're using.

         2- Cursor position can be shown on the screen.

         3- Graphical menus have been added to select items in
            graphics mode with the mouse or keyboard - Chapter 13.

         4- CAD-like functions have replaced the MS_OBJECT functions.

      i. General Changes

         1- Most RET_ functions have disappeared and the function
            used to set the function also returns the current value.
            This was to reduce the number of functions in the
            library.

         2- The library has been made more granular, linking only
            functions referenced in your program.

   3. Linking - Please make sure the subdirectories within these batch file
                are directed correctly for your system.

      a. RTLINK Clipper5.0  - see C50.BAT & FLIP50.LNK in examples
                              subdirectory.

      b. PLINK Summer 87 -  see C87.BAT & FLIP87 in examples.
                            subdirectory.  (You must combine FLIP5.LIB &
                            SUMMER87.LIB with a LIB.EXE library manager)
                            [ i.e. LIB FLIP5 +SUMMER87 ]

      c. WARPLINK - see WL.BAT and WARPLINK.LNK in examples
                    subdirectory. Uses WARPROOT.LIB for those
                    functions required to be in the root.

      d. BLINKER - see B50.BAT & BLINK50.LNK and B87.BAT & BLINK87.LNK.

      e. LINK    - see L.BAT is a batch file for using LINK.EXE 3.61 or
                   later.

If you have a problem with a function, try to find an example that
uses that function and compile and run it. Since CLIPPER 5.0 is not
totally solid yet, we're not sure what problems we may run into.
However, if you should have a problem that you can not correct, the
best way to get help is to develop a small example PRG that shows the
problem and send it to ProWorks VIA compuserve mail ID: 71247,1432,
or upload it to our BBS.

Flipper has been through a major rewrite and will possibly contain
problems that we are not currently aware of. Once we are aware that
we have a problem and can demonstrate it, we will proceed as quickly
as possible to correct it. The latest version of our software will
always be on the BBS for authorized users to download.

Sincerely,
