 DEBUG.DOC                BLINKER 3.3 debugger notes                 96.03.23
 ---------                --------------------------                 --------

  Blinker environment setting /DI3
  --------------------------------

  Setting /DI3 (DEBUG INT 3) in the BLINKER environment variable causes
  a debug interrupt 3 to be created just before the far jump to the
  first byte of the actual program. This is after both the extender and
  the Blinker Kernel have loaded and initialised. This instruction can
  be stepped into in the normal way to take you to the first byte of the
  actual program.

  In high level language programs this will be the library start up
  code, so to skip over the library start up to the start of your
  program (function MAIN) type 'G MAIN' or its equivalent.


  NuMega Soft-Ice/W support
  -------------------------

  Blinker 3.3 includes full support for the Soft-Ice/W debugger (from
  NuMega Technologies) for real, protected, dual and Windows programs on
  a SINGLE MACHINE. Soft-Ice/W actually loads and runs Windows and sits
  at the lowest system level, so it can debug anything at the source
  level, including VxDs and DOS protected mode programs.

  To use Soft-Ice/W with DOS real mode or protected mode programs simply
  open a DOS box, link for CODEVIEW with CVV 5, run WLDR xxxx.SYM (A SYM
  file is not actually needed) to load the symbols, source files etc and
  then run the program xxxx.EXE directly or WLDR xxxx.EXE. Do not use
  WLDR xxxx with no extension as DOS extended programs cannot currently
  be loaded at the same time as their symbols.

  To enable the interception of the INT 3 debugging interrupt by Soft-
  Ice/W use the command 'I3HERE ON' at the Soft-Ice/W command line (pop
  up Soft-Ice/W using Ctrl D), or by including it in the INIT line in
  the Soft-Ice/W initialisation file WINICE.DAT.

  Soft-Ice/W will then pop up when it encounters an INT 3 in the code,
  when a Control D is pressed, or it can be forced to pop up at the very
  start of the program by setting the value /DI3 in the BLINKER
  environment variable as described in the previous section. Soft-Ice/W
  will then pop up on a far JMP to the very first line of the real
  program, which can be stepped into with F8. As noted above, for high
  level languages the command 'G MAIN' will take you to start of the
  main program.

  Turbo Debugger support in real mode
  -----------------------------------

  Blinker support for Turbo debugger currently consists of real mode
  programs, displaying module source code with line numbers, public data
  symbols and non-overlaid public code symbols. We do not currently
  support overlaid code under the Turbo Debugger, but plan to in a
  subsequent release. TDCONVRT handles non-overlaid programs fine.

  If a program contains C or ASM overlays then the -c option must be
  used to create an external .TDS file, otherwise a Blinker 1203 error
  will occur at run time. This is because TDCONVRT places the debugging
  information directly after the root of the .EXE file. It also creates
  unusually large .TDS files with overlaid programs due to some internal
  confusion, but they appear to function correctly for the root part of
  the program.

  Overlaid programs will otherwise run correctly, but breakpoints on
  overlaid code will be ignored and display meaningless code at the
  symbol addresses.

  Turbo Debugger does not currently recognise the _main symbol as output
  from Blinker and TDCONVRT, so when running a program under the
  debugger select GOTO (Ctl G) and enter "main" to locate the start of
  the program.
