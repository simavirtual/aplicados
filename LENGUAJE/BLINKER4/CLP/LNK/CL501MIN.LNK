#  CL501MIN.LNK - Clipper 5.01 Clipper/Extend Script
#
#  Minimal overlaying - overlay most of EXTEND.LIB except TBROWSE
#
#  This script must be included outside of any BEGINAREA / ENDAREA commands
#  and after all libraries except LLIBCA if it is being used.
#
#  NOTE: for ease of use this script should be stored in your library
#  directory, (the directory pointed to by the LIB environment variable),
#  which will allow Blinker to find the script without you having to
#  specify a full path.
#
