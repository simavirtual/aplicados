READ.ME - Blinker 4 DLL Stubs for FivewWin.

The accompanying files ???????? should be compiled and linked to any
DLLs containing FiveWin code in order to resolve the unresolved
externals to functions within the FiveWin libraries.

The .PRGs are split into several files because of a Clipper limit on the
number of procedures in a single file.

The FiveWin libraries should only be linked to the main .EXE.
