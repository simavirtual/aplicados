  Schooner is  a powerful, full  featured database programming language
  in the style of Dbase III Plus(r) and Clipper(r) Summer 87.

  While programmed much the same way as these two "standards", Schooner
  provides a much easier  and faster development environment as well as
  a "function" based language (as opposed to a command based language).

  In addition, Schooner has  a complete set of graphics functions which
  allow you to  custom build virtually any  graphic screen desired. The
  graphics functions  also allow  you to  display text  and even accept
  user input.

  Schooner uses  the industry  standard Dbase(r) file  format (and even
  the  Clipper(r)  extensions  to  that  format)  and  the  development
  environment contains a powerful  text editor with all of the standard
  text editing features in  addition to those features required to pre-
  compile and run your programs.

  Schooner  can open  and  reference 9  databases  at once,  create and
  display graphics, print reports  (custom or from templates created in
  the report  writer) and  provide complete,  professional, stand-alone
  computer applications at a  fraction of the cost and time required by
  other systems.

  Not only  is the  Schooner development environment  provided, but the
  unlimited and royalty-free  Schooner runtime module is included. This
  allows you to develop applications and then release as many copies of
  that application  as desired. Simply  distribute the SCHOONRT.EXE and
  SCHOONRT.OVL runtime modules  with your pre-compiled .RUN modules and
  your application is complete.

                       SCHOONER 1.10 RELEASE NOTES

  The following  modifications to  version 1.00  have been  included in
  this release:

  TONE(): The  Tone() function  was inadvertently  left out  of Version
  1.00. This has been corrected.

  UDF(): The documentation  for the UDF() function  has been updated to
  reflect that the UDF() function does not return a value when assigned
  to an  "MV" variable. You  should pass data  back through public "MV"
  variables.  UDF() will  return values  when used  in nested  lines of
  code.

  E000: The  E000 Clipper  memory option is  now documented  and can be
  used to help resolve memory conflicts with DOS 5.00 and 6.00.

  MLCOUNT() and  MEMOLINE(): The documentation  for these functions has
  been modified  to show that  string variables and  not files are used
  within the function.

  EXIT: The  Exit option  of the  DO WHILE  - ENDDO  construct has been
  modified to properly handle  exits from nested IF - ENDIF constructs.
  This caused rare subscript out of range errors.
