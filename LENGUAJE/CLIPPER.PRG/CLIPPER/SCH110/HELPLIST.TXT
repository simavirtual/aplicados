    Welcome to the Schooner help example. This help screen is built from an IMGLISTBOX() function. The IMGLISTBOX() function is a fully programmableç
function which allows you to build virtually any type of scrolling or list selection function.
    For example, the scrolling FEATURES list found in the Features option on the main title screen is an IMGLISTBOX() function programmed to scrollç
text from a simple text file. The HOME LIST menu option found under the Options menu in this Real Estate example is an IMGLISTBOX() functionç
programmed to display and select from a .DBF file.
    Schooner Version 2.00 is filled with many other powerful GUI tools. Display .PCX images, build icon boxes, detect mouse activity, print graphicsç
and much more.
