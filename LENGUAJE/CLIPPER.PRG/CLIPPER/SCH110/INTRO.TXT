            Welcome to Schooner 2.00 GUI
    Schooner is the powerful, full featured database application development system. Version 2.00 is the enhanced Graphical User Interface developmentç
version of the highly praised Schooner 1.00 shareware version.
    Version 2.00 GUI now lets you create complete applications with attractive and easy to use Graphical User Interface mouse controls, icons andç
images. But we think Schooner is still the easiest and fastest way to program DOS applications because Schooner uses the Xbase style of programmingç
that lets you leverage the knowledge you already have.
    In fact, this entire demo is written in Schooner. To see the rest of the demo simply click the mouse cursor on the top left EXIT icon of thisç
listbox and check out each of the available options. The source code is also included so you can see how easy and fast it is to create applications inç
Schooner.
    So if you have not already, be sure to order your own copy today. See the ORDER option for details.
