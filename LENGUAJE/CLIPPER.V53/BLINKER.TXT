Why have over 50,000 programmers worldwide chosen the award-winning
Blinker product and what can it do for you?

If you program in CA-Clipper or C/C++, Blinker can save you time and
help you to create more powerful software. A unique blend of
functionality and value, Blinker combines a royalty-free DOS extender
with the fastest available Windows linker and DOS dynamic overlay
linker. CA-Clipper 5.3 includes a "real mode only" version of Blinker,
but only the full Blinker product offers you incremental linking, dual
mode, the Blinker DOS extender, the Windows linker, the swap package,
C/C++ support and much, much more!

Don't waste time waiting for your programs to link!

Incrementally link real and protected mode CA-Clipper programs in less
than a second with Blinker, the only product smart enough to relink just
your program changes. Dramatically increase productivity and virtually
eliminate "down time" with the fastest link times for real mode,
protected mode and Windows programs, all in one product.

Why worry about your runtime environment?

Combining a dynamic overlay linker with a DOS extender offers a unique
advantage. You can create protected mode and "dual mode" programs. No
larger than protected mode .EXEs, dual mode programs evaluate the
runtime environment and automatically run in either real or protected
mode accordingly. 

In real mode, dual mode programs run within the 640Kb conventional
memory limit, automatically managing overlays so you don't need to
design overlay structures. In protected mode, dual mode programs
directly access up to 16Mb of extended memory and 64Mb of virtual memory
under DOS, or in Windows and OS/2 DOS boxes.

Run any program from within your application!

Run a word processor, communications program or report generator from
within your main program using the Blinker swap package for real and
protected mode DOS. Blinker frees up all but 10Kb of the conventional
memory used by your main program to run the new program.

Start saving time and money now! Order Blinker today to receive your
free designer T-shirt!

Create NetWare-aware programs the easy way!

Directly access NetWare from within your programs using NOVLIB, the
first dual and protected mode network library for CA-Clipper. Voted Best
Network Library in 1994 and 1995 by the readers of Data Based Advisor
magazine, this powerful product features over 450 memory-efficient
functions designed to be called directly from CA-Clipper.

Easily integrate your programs with NetWare

Why shell out to DOS to use the Novell utilities when you can do the
same thing from within your program? A single NOVLIB command can replace
an entire NetWare utility, such as MAP to assign network drives, or
CAPTURE to redirect printer output. Create more user-friendly software
and save yourself the trouble of training your end-users to operate
NetWare!

Limited only by your imagination

Written in C and Assembler for maximum efficiency, NOVLIB enables you to
create quality programs for NetWare versions 2, 3 and 4 with minimal
memory overhead. All functions adhere strictly to NetWare security, so
users cannot perform any task without appropriate access rights.
Suitable for the beginner and the experienced programmer alike, NOVLIB
offers high level commands to make NetWare programming easy, plus low
level functions to help develop even the most comprehensive network
programs.

Take control of the NetWare environment:

Keep track of who has a particular file open on the network.
Log off users who have left for the day.
Find out when a file was last modified and by whom.
Send messages between workstations using NOVLIB's IPX / SPX functions.
Disable network message receipt.

Manage network printers:

Defer printing.
Print multiple copies of a document.
Automatically locate the first available network printer.
Move jobs to another printer to optimize printer usage.

Build security into your programs:

Limit access to network drives.
List all available network resources.
Display the user name at a specified workstation.
Access the file server serial number for copy protection purposes.
Limit a program to a specific number of users using semaphores.
Back up the bindery.

Monitor resources usage:

Monitor the use of your programs.
Charge a user's NetWare account for any resources, such as program use,
connection time and disk space.

receive a free designer T-shirt!
