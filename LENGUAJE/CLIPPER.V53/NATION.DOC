   CA-Clipper 5.3 International - Release Notes

   Copyright (c) 1995, Computer Associates International, Inc.
   All rights reserved.

   This file contains important information to all European customers
   needing national language support for their applications.


==========================================================================
1. Introduction

   The international release of CA-Clipper 5.3 provides runtime
   national language support, allowing users to develop applications
   for the European market.  Linking in the appropriate drivers will
   provide you with language translations of runtime messages and
   country-specific database collation sequences.


==========================================================================
2. Translated Message Support

   The international release of CA-Clipper 5.3 lets you change
   the default messages that appear in the product, to different
   languages.

   The messages affected by this are:
     Days of the Week    - day names used by the CDOW() function.
     Months of the Year  - month names used by CMONTH() function.
     Command Messages    - LABEL FORM SAMPLES message.
                           REPORT FORM titles.
                           GET System scoreboard messages.
     Runtime Errors      - Many runtime errors are translated
                           (This support is not provided with all drivers)

   A file MSG*.OBJ for each country (listed below) provides this
   support.


==========================================================================
3. Collation Sequences

   The collation sequence affects the order of your indexes, sort
   operations, array sorting and string comparisons.  It also includes
   the functions UPPER(), LOWER(), ISUPPER(), ISLOWER(), ISALPHA() and
   PICTURE clause routines. The == (Exactly equal--binary) operator is
   not affected by this.

   The default collation sequence for CA-Clipper is ASCII order.
   National language collations drivers reorder this sequence to
   include each country's accented characters in the correct place
   within the alphabet.

   An example, is the letter ‡-CHR(135).  With the default ASCII
   collation sequence, if this occurred in an index, it would appear
   between the letters †-CHR(134) and ˆ-CHR(136).  If you link in
   the French MDX collation driver and rebuild the index, the ‡-CHR(153)
   will now appear between the letters c-CHR(67) and d-CHR(68).
   Therefore, the compare operation described below can give
   different results, depending on which driver is linked.

      ? "‡" > "d"     // Returns .T. with ASCII collation sequence
      ? "‡" > "d"     // Returns .F. with French MDX collation sequence

   Note: Changing the collation sequence in an application with
         existing indexes will cause index corruption. You should
         rebuild all indexes before the application is used.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   3.1  Replaceable Database Drivers

   CA-Clipper 5.3 supports Replaceable Database Drivers (RDDs). Within
   each country, the different database products can provide a different
   collation sequence.  We, therefore, supply different nation language
   drivers for each of the RDDs.

   The following information outlines the specifics of collation support
   for these drivers.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   3.1.1  DBFNTX (Clipper) collation sequence support

   These DBFNTX language support drivers replace those provided with the
   European Nation Module Suite available for previous versions of
   CA-Clipper.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   3.1.2  DBFMDX (dBase IV) collation sequence support

   The DBFMDX National language drivers allow your applications to
   correctly update dBase IV database and associated MDX files.  Each
   country-specific version of dBase IV is contains its own unique
   collation sequence.  If you do not use the correct driver,
   index corruption will occur.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   3.1.3  DBFCDX (FoxPro 2) collation sequence support

   European versions of FoxPro 2 use the ASCII collation sequence.

   You can link the national language message drivers, if you wish to
   provide messages in your application.  This will not affect the
   collation sequence of the DBFCDX RDD.

   Note: Please inform your local Computer Associates office if a
         non-ASCII collation sequence is required for compatibility
         with the FoxPro 2 in your country.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   3.1.4  DBPX (Parodox 3.5) collation sequence support

   CURRENTLY, NO NATIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS RDD.

   You can link the national language message drivers, if you wish to
   provide messages in your application.  This will not affect the
   collation sequence of the DBPX RDD.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   3.2  Multiple RDD support

   You can only link one national language driver into a CA-Clipper
   5.3 application at any time.  It is not possible to provide the two
   different indexing orders simultaneously for users who require
   both DBFNTX and DBFMDX Replaceable Database Drivers in a single
   application.  You should, therefore, select the language driver
   for the RDD index with which you wish to remain compatible.
   You should rebuild all the indexes for the non-compatible RDD
   system.

   If support for your country is not provided, please contact your
   local Computer Associates office.

   All of the nation drivers are located in the OBJ directory of your
   installed CA-Clipper 5.3 product.


==========================================================================
5. Linking the national language drivers.

   Before you link in your language driver, ensure that you have set
   the environment variable, OBJ, to the \CLIPPER5\OBJ directory.
   For example, include "SET OBJ=C:\CLIPPER5\OBJ" in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

   To create a Clipper .EXE that provides support for your country,
   you must link in the Message Driver and the Collation Driver
   (for the RDD you wish to use). The syntax for this is:

     EXOSPACE FI <Objs> [, <MessageDriver>] [, <CollationDriver>]

   where  <Objs>            is the list of .OBJ files for your application
          <MessageDriver>   is the country messages driver
          <CollationDriver> is the country RDD driver

   For example, to build an application with both French messages and
   DBFMDX collation support use,

     EXOSPACE FI <objs>, MSGFRE, MDXFRE

   Both the Message and the Collation drivers are optional.  An
   application could provide translated messages with the standard ASCII
   collation driver. e.g.

     EXOSPACE FI <objs>, MSG

   By using the //INFO command line switch with your application, you
   can determine what National Language Drivers have been linked into
   your application. For example,

     C:\> MYAPP //INFO

   when linked with no language drivers, will display the following
   message before your application starts.

     Clipper (R) 5.3 Intl. (Rev. 330) US - ASCII Collation
                                     ÀÂÙ   ÀÄÂÄÙ
                                      ³      ³
                    National Message ÄÙ      ÀÄÄ National Collation
                    Driver Linked                   Driver Linked


   This message will change depending on what has been linked into your
   application. For the collation driver, the RDD and country will be
   displayed. For example if you have linked in the French nation
   drivers MSGFRE.OBJ and MDXFRE.OBJ, the application would display:

     Clipper (R) 5.3 Intl. (Rev. 330) FRENCH - FRENCH DBFMDX Collation


   If you are using the CA-Clipper Workbench, you can place the desired
   nation drivers into the 'Additional .OBJ Files' section of your
   default or application, linker options dialog.
