# Blinker 2.x Sample Link file for Clipper 5.x
#
# This sample script is intended to be used as a template for your own scripts
#
# Please refer to the manual for specific instructions for 3rd party libraries.
# In all cases the information provided by the vendor of a library for linking
# with BLINKER should supercede information in the Blinker manual or files.
#
# This script is set up a a development script, that enables incremental
# linking, and overlays only EXTEND.LIB from the Nantucket libraries. When
# incremental linking is enabled, applications will use somewhat more memory
# than normal, due to a certain amount of 'padding' being left at the end
# of each Clipper procedure, but this is offset by the extremely fast
# incremental link times.
#
# Before shipping a completed application, you should disable the incremental
# linking feature, which will save memory, and increase execution speed by:
#
#         a) Enabling the 5.x Clipper paging system
#         b) Removing the padding between procedures
#         c) Turning on symbol table compression
#
# For final links - UN-COMMENT the following command:
#
#BLINKER INCREMENTAL OFF
#
# Burn in your own Clipper variables here eg: F25;SWAPPATHC:\;
#
BLINKER EXECUTABLE CLIPPER F25;SWAPPATHC:\SWP;
#
# Specify the EXE filename here:
#
OUTPUT <EXE filename>
#
# List your Clipper 5.x object modules here. The first FILE mentioned in any
# Blinker link script MUST be a Clipper code module. The first module may be
# overlaid if required.
#
FILE <MAIN Clipper routine>

#   List the rest of your Clipper code files here.

#
# If you want the 5.x debugger UN-COMMENT the following:
# NOTE: The 5.x debugger library MUST be specified as a FILE
#
# FILE CLD.LIB
#
# Call the distribution script to overlay EXTEND.LIB
#
@CL501MIN.LNK
#
# Microsoft LLIBCA C library comes last if needed
#
# LIB LLIBCA
