#
#  Blinker link script for CA-Clipper 5.2
#
#  NOTE: Overlaying of RDDs may result in significant performance decrease.
#
#  For ease of use this script should be stored in your library directory,
#  (the directory pointed to by the LIB environment variable), which will allow
#  Blinker to find the script without you having to specify a full path.
#
#  This script MUST be included outside of any BEGINAREA / ENDAREA commands
#  and after all libraries (except LLIBCA if it is being used).
#
#  example:
#
#  FILE one
#  BEGINAREA
#       FILE two
#       FILE three
#       FILE four
#  ENDAREA
#  @CL520MID
#  @NTX520
#  LIB LLIBCA # (if used)
